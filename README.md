# Projets Hospisoc

This repository hosts the static website available at [projets.hospisoc.be](https://projets.hospisoc.be). The portal aggregates several experimental initiatives developed by Hospisoc.

## Projects

- **FLISP** (`/Flisp2/`): prototype for better social and medical information flow between care professionals.
- **Transports Dialyse** (`/transports-dialyse/`): site exploring transport organisation for dialysis patients.
- **Eladeb**: external psychosocial evaluation tool linked from the main page.
- An "About Hospisoc" section is available under `/about/`.

## Building and deploying

The site is fully staticâ€”no build step is required. Update the HTML files and push the changes to the main branch. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the latest revision.

To preview locally, open `index.html` in your browser or run a small HTTP server, for example:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

## Custom domain

The `CNAME` file configures the custom domain used by GitHub Pages. Currently it contains:

```
projets.hospisoc.be
```

Changing the domain requires updating this file and pointing the corresponding DNS record to GitHub Pages.
